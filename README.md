[Wrapping function is the most gain in this project.Wrapper functions ensure client code calls deeper backend functions properly. In this case, the threshold isn't obvious if calling only the merge sort itself. But under the wrapping function clients are clear to realize the thereshold should be provided. Besides, more failimarized on the merged sort and inversion sort, or their best and worst case of time efficiency.]
